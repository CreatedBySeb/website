For my Computer Engineering Masters, I opted to do research in the area of Computer Science Education under the supervision of Assistant Professor Glenn Strong, specifically on the [Pytch programming environment](https://pytch.scss.tcd.ie), which provides a Scratch-like environment for programming in Python as a transitionary step to full text-based programming.

I opted to explore the topic of physical computing in education, which involves using devices like Arduino boards, Raspberry Pi computers and the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) to teach students how to program. The BBC micro:bit in particular has a body of recent research into how introducing devices that learners can interact with physically may aid motivation and engagement; as an example, [this article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3017749) by Sentance et al. (which is now freely available as part of the ACM's 2026 Open Access changes) interviews teachers and students about their experiences learning with the device and shows such findings. The question of whether you could achieve similar benefits by somehow integrating a physical device into an otherwise virtual environment, like Pytch, while retaining the benefits such a virtual environment provides interested me greatly.

My research drew on prior work concerning various approaches to teaching programming with physical components, from the ['e-textiles' approach of the LilyPad](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1357054.1357123) to the modular [.NET Gadgeteer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2445196.2445315) (and many more besides mentioned in my bibliography), and also explored the application of the theories of constructivism and bricolage to computer science education, as well as incorporating other work in the areas of introductory CS education, student motivation and student inclusion. This research, alongside the existing body of work examining the micro:bit, led me to choosing it as the device to implement support for into Pytch due to the widespread availability and range of features, as well as influencing the design of the lesson I used for the trials. While one formal trial is not sufficient to prove the merit of the approach, there were strong signals that it was effective at achieving many of the benefits of incorporating physical devices, requiring more research into developing lessons suitable for this hybrid mode and additional studies to truly verify the results.

This was the first significant research project I undertook, and I enjoyed it greatly. Education in general is a topic I'm very passionate about, and I also deeply enjoy tinkering with hardware, so a research subject that combined practical implementation of hardware-based functionality and educational theory was ideal for me. While I have strayed from the academic path since, this experience was very inspiring and I hope to remain involved in research into the future, whether that is just reading or contributing also. My thesis is freely available as part of Trinity College Dublin's [Trinity's Access to Research Archive (TARA)](https://www.tara.tcd.ie/home), and if you're interested you can find it [here](https://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/112370).
