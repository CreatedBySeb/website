# My personal website

In my latest re-vamp of my personal website, I have decided to go with Astro to have a fully statically generated site that allows me to have a nice, Markdown-based content management system and leverage my existing JS experience. I've also opted to build it with GitHub Actions and host it on GitHub Pages for simplicity.
