# My personal website

In my latest re-vamp of my personal website, I have decided to go with Astro to have a fully statically generated site that allows me to have a nice, Markdown-based content management system and leverage my existing JS experience. I've also opted to build it with GitHub Actions and host it on GitHub Pages for simplicity. You can view the site itself at https://www.sebastienfulmer.com
